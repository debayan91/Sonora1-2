                    Internet pages, Investor Relations releases, annual and interim reports, outlooks, 
                    presentations, audio and video broadcasts of events (live or recorded) and other

                    about future developments that are based on the current assessments of the management. 
                    The words 'anticipate,' 'assume,' 'believe,' 'estimate,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'may/might,' 
                    'plan,' 'project,' 'should' and similar expressions are used to indicate forward-looking 
                    statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including an 
                    economic downturn in Europe or North America, changes in exchange rates, interest rates 
                    and raw materials prices, the launch of products by competitors, higher sales incentives, 
                    the successful implementation of the new business model for smart, and a decline in resale 
                    prices of used vehicles. If any of these risks and uncertainties (some of which are 
                    described in Sonora Group AG's most recent Annual Report under the heading 'Risk Report' 
                    and under the heading 'Risk Factors' in Form 20-F, which was submitted to the US Securities 
                    and Exchange Commission (SEC)) materialize or if the assumptions underlying any of our 
                    forward-looking statements prove incorrect, then our actual results may be materially 
                    different from those we express or imply by such statements. We do not intend or assume 
                    any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement 
                    applies only in relation to the situation prevailing on the date on which it is made.
